## Questions

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic is we discuss a lot of way to judge LLMs and find a domain that human might not evaluate on. Therefore, we try to make a Branchmark on model Judgments and compare with human preference on LLM generative response. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
We will try to design different level of prommpt and run experience on it to get result. we will also use LLM-as-judge to judge the model's response as LLM's choice. Than we will also do a human evaluation and compare withLLM's desicion. 

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
For the next quarter, we will finialize our evaluation system and also including different perspective of the prompts that design with different instruction and need to test out the best way to interact with LLMs. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
We will use both LLM-as-judge and Human evaluation in our project and make them become two individual leaderboard and comparing with the result.
